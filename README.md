# Salient object Detection Evaluation: Poolnet and Spectral Residual 

This is the code for paper I written for the module Text and Vision at Auckland University of Technology. The code from my project are refer to these repository: 

* https://github.com/backseason/PoolNet
* https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/SalMetric

Please download the necessary data and paste them in the data folder for the script to works. The link of the data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/194bC47VL3qk7VA-_5WnkADEgQdJULixR?usp=sharing)

To reproduce the result of original Spectral Residual algorithm, please run the `get_SR_result.py`. 

To get the evaluation result of Poolnet and Spectral Residual, please run the `evaluation.py`. Commented out the model result that you do not wish to test. The algorithm to compute the result is from the repo  https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/SalMetric
